**Object-Detection**

This Python code is designed to detect objects using the YOLOv5 model in either an image or video file. Here's a breakdown of how the code works:

üîß** Setup & Libraries**

import os, cv2, torch, shutil, csv
import pandas as pd
from IPython.display import display, Javascript
from google.colab import files
Imports necessary libraries for computer vision (cv2), deep learning (torch), file handling (os, shutil, csv), and Colab interaction (files, display, Javascript).

üöÄ **Load YOLOv5 Model**

model = torch.hub.load('ultralytics/yolov5', 'yolov5s')
Loads the pre-trained YOLOv5s (small) model from Ultralytics' repository using PyTorch Hub.

ü§ñ **User Choice: Image or Video**

choice = input("Do you want to detect objects in an 'image' or a 'video'? ")
Asks the user to choose whether they want to process an image or a video.

üñºÔ∏è **If Image Selected**

uploaded = files.upload()
img_path = next(iter(uploaded))
img = cv2.imread(img_path)
results = model(img)
Uploads an image.

Loads the image using OpenCV.

Runs object detection on the image using YOLOv5.


detected_img = results.render()[0]
cv2.imwrite('detected_image.jpg', detected_img)
Draws boxes on detected objects and saves the result.


csv_data = [['object_label', 'confidence']]
for *_, conf, cls in results.pred[0]:
    csv_data.append([model.names[int(cls)], float(conf)])
Creates a CSV file listing detected objects and their confidence scores.

üé• **If Video Selected**

video_path = input("Enter the path to your video:")
User enters video path (typically uploaded to /content in Colab).


shutil.rmtree(...); os.makedirs(...)
Clears previous runs‚Äô folders and creates new ones for frames.


cap = cv2.VideoCapture(video_path)
Opens the video file.


frame_interval = 5
Only processes every 5th frame to save time.


cv2.imwrite(...)
results = model(frame)
Extracts and saves frames, performs detection, draws bounding boxes, and saves new frames with detections.


csv_data.append([frame_name, model.names[int(cls)], float(conf)])
Logs detected objects per frame into a CSV file.

üé¨ **Create Output Video**

!apt-get install -y -qq ffmpeg
!ffmpeg -y -r {frame_rate} ...
Installs ffmpeg, a tool used to combine processed frames into a video.

üìä** Display and Download Outputs**

display(pd.read_csv(csv_file))
files.download(csv_file)
files.download(output_video)
Shows the CSV of detected objects in the notebook.

Allows downloading the final CSV and video with detections.

‚ùå **Invalid Option Handling**

else:
    print("Invalid choice. Please type 'image' or 'video'.")
Handles input errors from the user.
